## Main contribution of this project
- Almost all the code have been re-write in a more efficient way.
- Several graphs have been added and more analysis result have been added and modify to makes the project more comprehensive
- It can run in pytask successfully

## File Management
- My original code
  - **EPP_P** is the original jupiter notebook code replicating part of Table 5(NLS part) and Table 6 in the paper 
  - **EPP_Gmm** is the original jupiter notebook code replicating another part(Minimum Distance Estimator on Average Effort part) of the Table 5 in the paper
  - **Plot** is the original jupiter notebook code that making graphs
- My pytask code
  - SRC/epp_final/**data management** include the data processing process
  - SRC/epp_final/analysis/**NLS** are mainly converted from EPP_P for operating pytask
  - SRC/epp_final/analysis/**mini_dist** are mainly converted from EPP_Gmm for operating pytask
  - SRC/epp_final/**final** are mainly converted from plot for pytask reason
- My result
  - BLD/latex/**epp_final.pdf**
  - BLD/python/**data**
  - BLD/python/**figures**

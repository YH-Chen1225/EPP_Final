## Main contribution of this project
- Almost all the code have been re-write in a more efficient way.
- Several graphs have been added and more analysis result have been added and modify to makes the project more comprehensive
- It can run in pytask successfully

## File Management
- My original code
  - **EPP_P** is the original jupiter notebook code I wrote for replicating part of Table 5(NLS part) and Table 6 in the paper 
  - **EPP_Gmm** is the original jupiter notebook code I wrote for replicating another part(Minimum Distance Estimator on Average Effort part) of the Table 5 in the paper
  - **Plot** is the original jupiter notebook code I wrote for making graphs
- My pytask code
  - SRC/epp_final/**data management** include the data processing process
  - SRC/epp_final/analysis/**NLS** are mainly converted from EPP_P for operating pytask
  - SRC/epp_final/analysis/**mini_dist** are mainly converted from EPP_Gmm for operating pytask
  - SRC/epp_final/**final** are mainly converted from plot for pytask reason
- My result
  - BLD/latex/**epp_final.pdf**
  - BLD/python/**data**
  - BLD/python/**figures**

## How to operate this project
### Preparation before running this project:
If you do not have Ananconda, Git or LaTex, 
<br> please download and install it at first.

```
#First, pull the project to lacal repository via git bash
#Right click in the file that you want to put this file, and choose git bash, type following instructions
git init 
git remote add origin https://github.com/YH-Chen1225/EPP_Final
git pull origin master

#Second, open the anaconda powershell and cd to the path where the file located
cd (path)

#Third, activate the environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate epp_final

#Fourth, operating the project
pytask

#Fifth(optional), if there is any package that did not be installed, please install the package according to the error message in the anaconda powershell
pip install package_name 
```

## Abstract
This paper are discussing what motivates people to make efforts. Many factors in our real life would make people willing to make efforts, including money, donation to charity, ecouragement, comparing with other people, etc. There is a total of 18 treatments discussed in the paper. This project would analyze which treatment motivates people the most, what is the distribution, mean and standard error of people's effort, and what insightful information can we get from these distributions. Besides, both the power cost function and exponential cost function would be applied to predict people's effort for each treatment. In the process, all the parameters in these two functions would be estimated by several methods and assumptions. Finally, the estimation result would be compared with the one estimated by the authors of the paper graphically.
